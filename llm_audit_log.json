This appeal by certificate raises the\nquestion whether the High Court went wrong, in the circumstances of the case, to give a decree for\nspecific performance of an agreement to sell in favour of the plaintiff.

In regard to plots Nos. 2 and 3 the plaintiff offered the highest bid of Rs.\n12,000/-. He wanted to purchase the plots for the purpose of starting his business. When the\nplaintiff tendered one-fourth of the sale price as earnest money in accordance with the terms of the\nauction, the defendants unlawfully refused to accept it.

He further\nstated that he gave up the idea of selling the plots and that after obtaining the necessary permission\nfrom the Municipality he began to build shops on the said plots. The City Civil Judge held that the\nsuit plots were knocked down at the auction in favour of the plaintiff and that the lst defendant\nrefused to take the earnest money.

He further held that though the plaintiff gave notice as early as\nAugust 30, 1954, to the defendants, he did not take any steps to enforce his contract and that though\nhe knew of the construction a couple of months before he filed the suit, he kept quiet and allowed\nthe 1st defendant to complete his construction and, therefore, it was not a fit case where he could, in\nexercise of his discretion, give a decree for specific performance; instead he awarded to the plaintiff\na sum of Rs. 500/- towards damages. On appeal, a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High\nCourt, on a consideration of the evidence, came to the conclusion that the delay in filing the suit was\ndue to the illness of the plaintiff's wife and also on account of the demolition of one of his houses by\nthe Municipal Corporation, that he came to know for the first time on April 13, 1955, that the 1st\ndefendant was raising a structure on the suit plots and that without any loss of time within a few\ndays thereafter he filed the suit.

At that time\nexcept a pair of trousers, nothing incriminating was found by the police, much less\nseized. It is also the admitted case of the prosecution that after the flat was searched\nit was locked again and the keys were kept with none other than the brother-in-law of\nthe appellant the reasons for which we are unable to fathom. Be that as it may, it is\nalso an admitted fact that since then the appellant had no access to his flat till it was\nsearched on September 9, 1980. If inspite of these tell tale circumstances a lot of\narticles - containing `Group A' blood - was found inside that flat on September 9,\n1980 - it only shows that the entire story of search and recovery of the articles is a\nmyth. 130 The matter can be viewed from another angle also. If really the appellant\nhad committed the murder inside his flat, as is the prosecution case, he would see\nthat evidence which may implicate him w as not available to the prosecution. In this\ncase it was not at all difficult for him to remove the articles allegedly found for he had\nabout 6 days time at his disposal to get the same done with the keys which were with\nhis brother-in-law. However, the reasons given by the trial Court to disbelieve this\npart of the prosecution case are altogether different. Though the reasons of the trial\nCourt in this regard cannot be said to be improper we need not pursue the matter\nfurther, having regard to the conclusions we have drawn from the admitted facts of\nthe case.\n14. Apart from the above two circumstances, namely, circumstance No. iii and vi, the\nonly other circumstance which the High Court found on discussion of the evidence to\nhave been conclusively proved was the appellant was last seen with the deceased at\n1.30 P.M. in his (appellant's) flat (circumstance No. ii). Even if we proceed on the\nbasis, notwithstanding the finding of the trial Court in this regard, that the above\ncircumstance stands proved it does not further the prosecution case for by itself it\ndoes not lead to the only conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offences\nalleged against him.\n15. For the foregoing discussion we unhesitatingly hold that the reasons given by the\ntrial Court for recording the order of acquittal in favour of the appellant are cogent\nand convincing and the High Court was not at all justified in disturbing the same by\nreappraising the evidence. The appeal is, therefore, allowed.

It has been argued on behalf of the applicants that in view of the acquittal of the applicants of the\noffences under Sections 323, 379 and 504, I. P. C. it cannot be said that the intention of the\napplicants was to commit any offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of\nhis property. It is no doubt true that they have been acquitted tinder the aforesaid sections, but the\ntrial Court has clearly given a finding to the effect that Mathura was beaten by the applicants and the\nappellate Court has upheld the conclusions arrived at by the trial Court. In view of the said findings\nthe mere fact that they were acquitted under the aforesaid sections is quite immaterial. The fact\nremains that the applicants did resort to wrongful force for taking possession of the said shop. They\nhad absolutely no justification for doing it. It has been held in -- 'Keshar Singh v. Rex', AIR 1950 All\n157 (A), that \"it would be impossible to produce direct evidence of the Intention. The intention has\nin most cases to be inferred from the circumstances. Where the probable consequence of the act\nalleged to be criminal trespass was to cause annoyance to the persons in possession it will be\npresumed that it was committed with that intention. The presumption will hold good if it is not\nrebutted.\"\n6. It has further been argued on behalf of the applicants that Ramnath was the real owner of the\nshop and that if the title vested in him, he cannot be guilty of any offence, if he took forcible\npossession of the property. I do not think that there is any merit in this argument. Where a person\nhas been in peaceful possession of property for a fairly long time, it is not open to the claimant of the\nproperty to resort to force for the purpose of ejecting him. As has been held in -- 'Sm. Ram Kali v.\nGaya Prasad', AIR 1950 All 653 (B):\n\"Section 441 is designed to protect possession as distinguished from title in the sense\nthat the question in whom title to the land or property vests is foreign to the offence.\nThe mere fact that the accused put forward a bona fide claim to the property would\nnot save him from the consequences of the entry into the house in possession of the\ncomplainant if his intention was to take the property out of the complainant's\npossession without her consent and to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful\nloss to her.\"\n7. I understand that Ramnath has filed a civil suit for determination of the question of title. The civil\nCourt is, therefore, the proper forum for giving a finding on that particular point. So far as the\ncriminal Courts are concerned, they are primarily concerned, with the factum of possession and in\nview of the evidence adduced on behalf of Mathura in this case, it must be held that possession was\nclearly with him.\n8.

Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n1. On 17.8.1979 the Food Inspector, Sorar, purchased 375 grams of Soyabean oil from the shop of the\npetitioner, Tulsiram. The Soyabean oil purchased was divided into three parts; each part was filled\nin a bottle; each bottle was sealed; and, one of the bottles was sent to the Public Analyst, Raipur for\nanalysis. The Public Analyst found that the sample was adulterated as it contained traces of cotton\nseed oil. On 29.11.1979 a complaint was filed on the basis of the report of the Public Analyst, in the\ncourt of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Balod, On 17.12.1979 a copy of the report of the Public\nAnalyst was forwared to the petitioner as required by Rule 9-A of Prevention of Food Adulteration\nRules. The accused-petitioner however made no application to the Trial Court to have one of the\nsamples sent to the Central Food Laboratory for further analysis. He was content merely to deny\noffence. After due trial he was convicted by the Magistrate on 8.9.1982, under Section 16(1)(a)(i) of\nthe Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six\nmonths and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/-. The appeal preferred by the petitioner to the Sessions\nJudge, Durg and the Revision Petition preferred thereafter to the High Court of Madhya Pradesh\nwere rejected. The petitioner now seeks special leave to appeal to this Court under Article 136 of the\nConstitution.\n2. The learned Counsel for the petitioner urged before us that Rule 9-A of the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Rules, which has been substituted for Rule 9(j) in 1977, now prescribes that the Local\n(Health) Authority shall immediately after the institution of the prosecution forward a copy of the\nreport of the Public Analyst by registered post or by hand to the person from whom the sample wasTulsiram vs State Of Madhya Pradesh on 11 October, 1984\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19922/ 1\ntaken by the Food Inspector, that the word 'immediately' occurring in Rule 9-A showed that it\nbrooked no delay and that as there was a delay of 18 days, in the present case, in forwarding the\nreport to the petitioner, the prosecution was vitiated and petitioner was entitled to be acquitted.",

      "text": "n the night between\nSeptember 4 and 5, 1980 by the police after breaking open its lock. At that time\nexcept a pair of trousers, nothing incriminating was found by the police, much less\nseized. It is also the admitted case of the prosecution that after the flat was searched\nit was locked again and the keys were kept with none other than the brother-in-law of\nthe appellant the reasons for which we are unable to fathom. Be that as it may, it is\nalso an admitted fact that since then the appellant had no access to his flat till it was\nsearched on September 9, 1980. If inspite of these tell tale circumstances a lot of\narticles - containing `Group A' blood - was found inside that flat on September 9,\n1980 - it only shows that the entire story of search and recovery of the articles is a\nmyth. 130 The matter can be viewed from another angle also. If really the appellant\nhad committed the murder inside his flat, as is the prosecution case, he would see\nthat evidence which may implicate him w as not available to the prosecution. In this\ncase it was not at all difficult for him to remove the articles allegedly found for he had\nabout 6 days time at his disposal to get the same done with the keys which were with\nhis brother-in-law. However, the reasons given by the trial Court to disbelieve this\npart of the prosecution case are altogether different. Though the reasons of the trial\nCourt in this regard cannot be said to be improper we need not pursue the matter\nfurther, having regard to the conclusions we have drawn from the admitted facts of\nthe case.\n14. Apart from the above two circumstances, namely, circumstance No. iii and vi, the\nonly other circumstance which the High Court found on discussion of the evidence to\nhave been conclusively proved was the appellant was last seen with the deceased at\n1.30 P.M. in his (appellant's) flat (circumstance No. ii). Even if we proceed on the\nbasis, notwithstanding the finding of the trial Court in this regard, that the above\ncircumstance stands proved it does not further the prosecution case for by itself it\ndoes not lead to the only conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offences\nalleged against him.\n15. For the foregoing discussion we unhesitatingly hold that the reasons given by the\ntrial Court for recording the order of acquittal in favour of the appellant are cogent\nand convincing and the High Court was not at all justified in disturbing the same by\nreappraising the evidence. The appeal is, therefore, allowed. The appellant, who is no\nbail, is discharged from his ball bonds.Ramesh Babulal Doshi vs The State Of Gujarat on 2 May, 1996\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31041/ 8",
